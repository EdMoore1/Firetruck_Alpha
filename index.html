				<p>The FireTruck game has been effectively designed to the meet needs of the balanced scorecard and good game principles. The game addresses these components through utilising game features to deliberately demonstrate the differences between a game built without good game principles to transform a good game into a purposely made dysfunctional game.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Such features that have been incorporated into the fire truck game include deliberate spelling &amp; grammar mistakes in story highlights, technical mistakes that affect the running of the game and purposely cause errors, with further element such as a limited world, significant changes in challenges &amp; difficulty curves, little back story details and purposely giving varying player feedback for tasks which may confuse the player. The ability for the fire truck game to highlight these components effectively demonstrates good game principles and provides a mechanism for learning and reinforcement of good game principles by a effective contrast between a game that operates as expected and game that has been purposely designed to include errors.</p>

				<h2>How to play</h2>
				<p>After a level has started, every 30 seconds a new fire will spark. Fires will spread and you must put them out by sending orders to the trucks to put out the fires.</p>

				<h3>Sending Orders</h3>
				<p>To send out a truck, drag from the FireStation to where you want the truck to go. You can reissue orders to a truck by dragging from the truck to it's new destination.</p>

				<h3>Putting out Fires</h3>
				<p>Trucks automatically put out all fires around it. The time to put out fires is dependant on what is on fire for example, a building will be harder to put out than grass.</p>

				<h3>Winning a level</h3>
				<p>You can win a level by putting out all the fires.</p>

				<h3>Losing a level</h3>
				<p>You will lose a level if the maximum damage for the level is reached. This is shown in the top left corner</p>

				<h3>Scoring</h3>
				<p>You will get points for putting out fires.<br/>
				   After each round you will also get extra points for saving buildings.<br/>
				   You can get additional points for spotting typos, you can identify them by pressing 'e'.</p>

				<h2>Story</h2>
				<p>The FireTruck puts out fires around town. You, the controller of the FireTruck, are not only responsible for the safety of the town's buildings and landscapes but also, its citizens!</p>
				<br/>
				<p>As you progress and become a master of the FireTruck, you will encounter a variety of elements that don't appear to belong in the game. These elements will appear at random, and it is your job, as the controller of the FireTruck, to handle whatever obstacle comes in your way.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Be weary of your time and fires burning in certain areas. The last thing you want as FireTruck controller is a burned down building on your hands.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Good Luck!</p>
