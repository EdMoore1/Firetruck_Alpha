				<p>The FireTruck game has been effectively designed to the meet needs of the balanced scorecard and good game principles. The game addresses these components through utilising game features to deliberately demonstrate the differences between a game built without good game principles to transform a good game into a purposely made dysfunctional game.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Such features that have been incorporated into the fire truck game include deliberate spelling &amp; grammar mistakes in story highlights, technical mistakes that affect the running of the game and purposely cause errors, with further element such as a limited world, significant changes in challenges &amp; difficulty curves, little back story details and purposely giving varying player feedback for tasks which may confuse the player. The ability for the fire truck game to highlight these components effectively demonstrates good game principles and provides a mechanism for learning and reinforcement of good game principles by a effective contrast between a game that operates as expected and game that has been purposely designed to include errors.</p>

				<h2>Story</h2>
				<p>The FireTruck puts out fires around town. You, the controller of the FireTruck, are not only responsible for the safety of the town's buildings and landscapes but also, its citizens!</p>
				<br/>
				<p>As you progress and become a master of the FireTruck, you will encounter a variety of elements that don't appear to belong in the game. These elements will appear at random, and it is your job, as the controller of the FireTruck, to handle whatever obstacle comes in your way.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Be weary of your time and fires burning in certain areas. The last thing you want as FireTruck controller is a burned down building on your hands.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Good Luck!</p>
